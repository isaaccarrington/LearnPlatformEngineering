# Learn Platform Engineering
Step by step guide on becoming a Platform Engineer.

## Pre-amble
This is a **work in progress**. Intended to be useful but not cover everything, also primarily
focused on technical skills only.

## The Goal

The goal is to be competent in these technical skills as quickly as possible:

- Competency in a programming language
- Git
- Networking (TLS, DNS)
- Datacentre basics (racks, servers, switches)
- Virtualisation platform basics
- Storage
- SQL
- VM basics (what is a VM, provisioning, destroying, maintaining)
- Operating system administration
- Load balancing and scaling
- Continuous integration
- Continuous development
- Security (RBAC, Least Privilege, CVEs)
- Observability
- Monitoring and Alerting

## Becoming competent in a programming language

Here is why you should invest in this skill and why it isn't necessarily the programming language
itself that will help you, but the skills in modern software development that will.

All the scripting you will do for the rest of your career will benefit from being skilled in modern
software development. Scripts, like software development need to be maintainable and reliable.

Once you know one programming language you will find it easier to pick up new ones. A lot of tools
you use as a platform engineer seem to use configuration that is either from a programming language
or derived from one. So knowing a proper programming language actually helps you pick up new platform
tools.

The tools we use are written in a programming language ! Yes, of course they are. But why do I care?
Because when you are maintaining this tool and it stops working, guess who has to fix it, you `;)`.
